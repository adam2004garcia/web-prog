Project Description:

This project is about an Academic Homepage that allows users to view an About section of the student, coursework that the student has done, projects that the student has completed or is working on, as well as contact information. The problem that it solves is some students need a “project” to show on their resume, and this can actually work as a resume. Professors and companies can also take a look at the academic homepage for the student and see their credentials. Having something like this is a very good jump start towards getting a job, and also work in the real world.
